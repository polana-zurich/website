			<p>We are thrilled to invite you to an <b>exclusive lecture</b> by <b>Prof. Andrzej Dragan</b> – a distinguished Polish physicist, professor at the University of Warsaw, 
			and a pioneer in quantum physics research.<br><br>
			Prof. Dragan is not only a highly respected scientist but also a <b>major science communication star</b>. His unique approach to explaining complex physics concepts has 
			gained immense recognition – his lectures and videos on YouTube have reached <b>up to 10 million views!</b> With his unconventional style and sharp wit, he inspires people 
			worldwide to dive deeper into the mysteries of science.<br><br>
			During this lecture, Prof. Dragan will explore the <b>relationship between quantum mechanics and relativity</b> – two fundamental yet seemingly contradictory pillars of 
			modern physics. He will discuss how these theories intertwine and what their connection means for our understanding of the universe.<br><br>
			This event is a <b>unique opportunity</b> to explore cutting-edge physics concepts with one of the most prominent science communicators.<br><br>
			The lecture will be held in English. We warmly invite everyone to join, regardless of whether they are from ETH, another university, or not studying at all.<br><br>
			Don’t miss out—mark your calendars!
