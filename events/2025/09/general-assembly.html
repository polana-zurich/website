			<p>Hi everyone! A new semester has begun, and with it another year of building the Polish student community 
				in Zurich. Our efforts are only possible thanks to your support, which is why we warmly invite you to the 
				General Assembly of POLANA, taking place on Wednesday, September 24th at 18:00 in CHN F46. 
				<br><br>We especially encourage those interested in supporting our work by joining the board – during the meeting, elections 
				will be held for all board positions. 
				<br><br>Everyone curious to get to know us better is also very welcome! 
				We’ll share more about our past activities and our plans for the upcoming semester. There will be some 
				snacks, and afterwards we’ll head together for a beer at bQm. See you there!</p>
