	<h1>About us</h1>
	<p>Siema! We are POLANA (Polish Academic Network Abroad). We are an association that brings together Polish 
		students and students interested in Polish culture in Zurich and the surrounding area to celebrate Polish 
		traditions and get to know each other. From movie nights and hikes to traditional Christmas Eve dinners, there 
		is something for everyone at POLANA.

	<h1 id="supportus">Support us</h1>
	<p>POLANA is a non-profit organization, but to keep operating and to cover costs upfront (venue rentals, ingredients, materials for events), we need to maintain basic financial liquidity.
		We work entirely on a volunteer basis, dedicating our free time to supporting and sharing Polish culture, which is why your help is so important to us.
		We are grateful for every donation either via bank transfer:<br>
